// NodeStatus is the lifecycle status of a node in the workflow graph.
//
// The status is the engine's single source of truth for what a node
// is doing. It mediates between the trigger buffer (what wants to
// run), the in-process task table (what is currently running), and
// the persisted node history (what has run).
type NodeStatus uint8

const (
	// NodeInactive means the node has not been touched yet. This is
	// the zero value.
	NodeInactive NodeStatus = iota

	// NodePending means the node is ready to run. It may be queued
	// because its input has arrived (consumed from the trigger
	// buffer) or because it is being retried after a failure. The
	// scheduler may keep a NodePending node from starting if the
	// engine's max-concurrency cap is reached.
	NodePending

	// NodeRunning means the engine has started a task for this node.
	// The task is in flight in the current process. A NodeRunning
	// entry that has no live task in the run state (e.g. after a
	// process restart) must be re-scheduled.
	NodeRunning

	// NodeCompleted means the node finished and produced its output.
	// This is a terminal status for normal execution, but a node in
	// NodeCompleted may still be re-triggered by a fresh entry in
	// the trigger buffer (this is what enables loops as graph
	// cycles).
	NodeCompleted

	// NodeWaiting means the node is paused. Two cases share this
	// status:
	//
	//   1. Human-in-the-loop: the node yielded a RequestInput and
	//      is blocked until a function-response payload resumes it.
	//   2. Fan-in (WaitForOutput=true, e.g. JoinNode): the node ran
	//      but did not yet produce its final output because not all
	//      predecessors have triggered it.
	//
	// While any node is NodeWaiting the workflow does not finalize.
	NodeWaiting

	// NodeFailed means the node returned an error and the retry
	// policy (if any) has been exhausted. Terminal.
	NodeFailed

	// NodeCancelled means the node was cancelled: either because a
	// sibling node failed and the engine cancelled all running tasks,
	// or because the invocation context was cancelled from outside the
	// engine. Terminal in both cases — the two are told apart by
	// whether the run reports an error, not by this status.
