# AGENTS.md

Context for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Copilot, etc.)
working in the ADK Go repository. Human contributors should start with
CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Project overview

ADK Go (`google.golang.org/adk/v2`) is an open-source, code-first Go toolkit for
building, evaluating, and deploying AI agents. It is model-agnostic but
optimized for Gemini, and is one of several ADK implementations — Go, Python,
Java, Kotlin, and TypeScript — that share a conceptual model but are independent
codebases. Requires the Go version declared in `go.mod`.

Development happens on `main`, the 2.x line. `v1` is the maintenance branch for
1.x; target it only for fixes that must ship to 1.x. See
[Branches](CONTRIBUTING.md#branches).

## Skills

See [AI-assisted development](CONTRIBUTING.md#ai-assisted-development) in
`CONTRIBUTING.md` for what this repo ships. The rule for agents: task-specific
instructions live in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, and you read the matching
one before starting that kind of work.

## Setup & core commands

This repo is multi-module: the root module `google.golang.org/adk/v2` plus
`plugin/agentanalytics`. Set up a Go workspace first — `go.work` is local-only
and gitignored, and `go work init` fails if one already exists:

```bash
test -f go.work || go work init
go work use -r .
```

Then run from the repo root. The `work` pattern spans every module in the
workspace, while `./...` matches only the module you are standing in:

- Build:       `go build -mod=readonly work`
- Test:        `go test -race -mod=readonly -count=1 -shuffle=on work`
- Single pkg:  `go test -race ./agent/...`
- Lint:        `golangci-lint run`   (per module; v2, CI pins v2.3.1; config in `.golangci.yml`)
- Tidy check:  `go mod tidy -diff`   (per module; must print nothing)
- Format:      `golangci-lint fmt`   (per module; applies gofumpt + goimports)

Without a `go.work`, `work` silently falls back to the root module alone and
still exits 0, so confirm the workspace exists before trusting a green run.

Install the same `golangci-lint` CI uses. A newer release reports findings CI
does not, which reads as a failure you did not cause:

```bash
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.3.1
```

`golangci-lint` and `go mod tidy` are per-module, so a run from the repo root
covers only the root module. This loop covers every module the way CI does:

```bash
for m in $(find . -name go.mod -not -path './.git/*' -exec dirname {} \;); do
  ( cd "$m" \
    && go mod tidy -diff \
    && go build -mod=readonly ./... \
    && go test -race -mod=readonly -count=1 -shuffle=on ./... \
    && golangci-lint run ) || echo "FAILED: $m"
done
```

`golangci-lint run` reports formatting problems too, as `gofumpt` and
`goimports` findings, but it does not fix them. `golangci-lint fmt` rewrites
the files in place, and `golangci-lint fmt --diff` shows what it would change
without writing anything.

## Definition of done

A change is complete only when all of these pass locally:

1. `go build` (above) succeeds.
2. `go test` (above) is green.
3. `golangci-lint run` reports no findings, in every module.
4. `go mod tidy -diff` prints nothing, in every module.
5. New/changed behavior has tests, and each one has been seen to fail with the
   source change reverted. See [Before you open a PR](#before-you-open-a-pr).
6. Every new Go file starts with the Apache 2.0 license header (enforced by `goheader`).
7. The root `go.mod` does not require an in-repo submodule (enforced by the
   `guardrail` CI job).

## Repository layout

- `agent/`     Agent interface + types (`llmagent`, `remoteagent`, `workflowagent`;
  `workflowagents/` holds `loopagent`, `parallelagent`, `sequentialagent`)
- `runner/`    Execution engine that drives the run loop
- `workflow/`  Node/graph-based workflow engine for multi-agent apps
- `model/`     LLM abstraction (`gemini`, `apigee`, `openaimodel`)
- `tool/`      Tool/Toolset interface + built-in tools (incl. `skilltoolset/`, `mcptoolset/`)
- `session/`   Conversation state + events
- `memory/`, `artifact/`   Long-term memory and file/data services
- `auth/`      Credentials and auth providers for outbound requests
- `agentregistry/`  Client for Google Cloud Agent Registry (A2A agents, MCP servers, models)
- `plugin/`    Cross-cutting lifecycle hooks; `plugin/agentanalytics` is a separate module
- `server/`    HTTP servers (`adkrest` is primary; `adka2a`, `agentengine`)
- `cmd/`       CLI (`adkgo`) and server launchers
- `telemetry/`, `util/`   Public helper packages
- `platform/`  Overridable seams for time & UUID generation (deterministic tests)
- `internal/`  Private packages — NOT public API; `internal/httprr` is vendored
- `examples/`  Runnable example agents (quickstart, tools, a2a, skills, …)
- `scripts/`   Repo tooling (ADK Web container build and asset refresh)

## Conventions & idioms

- **Streaming:** agent runs return `iter.Seq2[*session.Event, error]`; consume
  with `for event, err := range … {}`. Don't collect events into a slice.
- **Interface-first:** the core abstractions are interfaces — `agent.Agent`,
  `tool.Tool`, `tool.Toolset`, and a separate `Service` interface in each of
  `session`, `artifact` and `memory`. Concrete implementations live in
  sub-packages or `internal/`, except the in-memory ones, which sit beside the
  interface they implement.
- **Callbacks over subclassing** (`Before*`/`After*` for Agent/Model/Tool). A
  `Before` model or tool callback short-circuits the underlying call when it
  returns either a non-nil result or a non-nil error. `BeforeAgentCallback`
  behaves differently: only non-nil content short-circuits, and returning an
  error surfaces that error without stopping the agent from running.
- **Errors:** wrap with `fmt.Errorf("…: %w", err)`. Use `%v` only when
  deliberately not exposing the wrapped error's type. Don't convert existing `%w` to `%v`;
  it might break callers silently. Wrap sentinels first:
  `fmt.Errorf("%w: …: %w", ErrX, err)`. Tool confirmation uses sentinel errors
  (e.g. `tool.ErrConfirmationRequired`).
- Prefer an existing helper over a new one; keep packages small and focused.

## Logging and error messages

Never put user or model data into a log line or an error message. Prompts,
model output, tool arguments and results, session and event contents, request
and response bodies, headers, credentials, tokens and API keys are customer
content or security material, at every level including debug. Log the shape
instead — a type, a count, a length, an ID you generated — so a failure stays
diagnosable without recording what the user said.

The rule covers any error you construct or wrap, and any test assertion message
that would echo a payload. URLs are not exempt: query parameters carry tokens
and identifiers.

## Comments

Doc comments are the public API documentation. `pkg.go.dev` renders them, so
write for a reader who cannot see the implementation, and follow
[Go Doc Comments](https://go.dev/doc/comment).

Length is not the measure — content is. Say what a caller cannot infer from the
signature, and leave out what they can.

Worth the words, however many it takes: invariants, what the zero value means,
whether the type is safe for concurrent use, ownership and lifetime, error
conditions, special cases, and a short example when the shape of the call is
not obvious. `agent.InvocationContext` runs to several paragraphs and a diagram
because the invocation, agent-call and step hierarchy cannot be read off the
method set. That is the standard, not an exception.

Not worth the words, at any length:

- Restating the signature.
- `Parameters:`, `Returns:`, `Args:` and `Usage:` headings, carried over from
  other languages' docstring conventions. Go has no equivalent, and `go doc`
  does not treat them as headings — it renders them as body text, and folds a
  lone `Usage:` into the paragraph beneath it. Name parameters and results
  inline in prose instead.
- The algorithm the implementation happens to use. That belongs in the body,
  where it will be updated alongside the code.

Inline comments say why, not what. One restating the statement below it is
noise, and reasoning too long to sit in the code belongs in the PR description.

Check that a doc comment describes the function it sits on. One copied from a
neighbour and left unedited is a recurring defect here.

Every `TODO` carries a marker — `TODO(username)` as the style guide asks and
most of this repo does, or `TODO(#1234)` when an issue tracks it. A bare
`TODO:` belongs to nobody and gets forgotten.

## Extending the framework

- **Add a tool:** wrap a Go function with
  `functiontool.New[Args, Results](cfg, handler)` (Args/Results are structs), or
  implement the `tool.Tool` interface for full control.
- **Add a toolset:** implement `tool.Toolset`; its `Tools(ctx)` may return
  different tools per invocation.
- **Add an agent type:** follow the `agent/workflowagents/*` packages; construct
  agents via `llmagent.New` / `agent.New`, not by implementing `agent.Agent`
  directly.
- **Add cross-cutting behavior:** register a `plugin.New(plugin.Config{...})`
  hook (`Before*`/`After*` for run/agent/model/tool) instead of editing the loop.

## API shape

- **Prefer a config struct to functional options for a new constructor** —
  `New(cfg Config)`, as in `runner.New`, `llmagent.New` and `agenttool.New`.
  Both styles exist today (`workflow.New` and `telemetry.New` take options), so
  this is the direction for new code rather than a description of the repo.
  Match the package you are working in before reaching for the other style.
- Export as little as you can. A new exported symbol is a permanent commitment,
  and `apidiff` holds you to it.
- Error messages name what failed and give the context needed to place it —
  `parallel worker %s expects a slice input, got %T`, not `invalid input type`.
  Match the messages already in that package.
- Sentinel errors are package-level vars, wrapped as
  `fmt.Errorf("%w: …", ErrX)` and tested with `errors.Is`, never by string
  match.
- In new code, keep `fmt.Print*` out of library and server packages, and
  `context.Background()` out of anything but `main`, tests and examples — plumb
  the caller's context through, or use `context.WithoutCancel(ctx)` when a
  resource must outlive the request. Neither is linted, and existing code has
  exceptions, so fix one only in a PR that is already about that code.

## Multi-module development

See [Multi-Module Development](CONTRIBUTING.md#multi-module-development) in
`CONTRIBUTING.md` for policy, steps to add a new module, and release tagging.

## Testing

- **LLM traffic is replayed, not live.** A package with `testdata/*.httprr`
  replays through `internal/httprr` with no flags and no credentials. Each of
  those files is an **HTTP recording**: one request-and-response exchange,
  captured once against a real model and replayed on every run afterwards, so
  tests stay deterministic and need no API key. `session/vertexai` uses a
  second, unrelated system for **RPC recordings** — `rpcreplay` with
  `testdata/*.replay` files, refreshed by `UPDATE_REPLAYS=true`. Never add a
  live model or network call to a test.
- `-httprecord` takes a **regexp matched against the recording's file path**,
  not a `-run` test-name filter. Keep it as narrow as the set of recordings you
  mean to replace: recording against a live model produces a different response
  every time, so a broad pattern rewrites unrelated recordings and buries the
  intended change.
- To re-record **one** exchange — the normal case — supply real credentials
  (e.g. `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) and name **the recording file**, which is often not
  the name of a top-level test. Most recordings here are subtest-derived, so a
  pattern built from the top-level test name matches nothing, records nothing,
  and still exits 0. List the directory first, then name the file exactly:
  ```bash
  ls <pkg>/testdata/*.httprr
  go test ./<pkg>/ -run TestToolCallback \
      -httprecord='TestToolCallback_before_callback_response_used\.httprr$'
  ```
  Commit only that `testdata/*.httprr`.
- To re-record a whole package, run `go generate ./<pkg>/...`; each package's
  `//go:generate go test -httprecord=…` directives are scoped so that every
  recording is captured exactly once. The test that enforces this,
  `TestHTTPRecordDirectivesPartitionCassettes` in `internal`, keeps an older
  name for the same thing.
- Prefer table-driven tests; shared helpers live in `internal/testutil`.
- **A green suite does not prove the live path works.** Recorded traffic is
  replayed, so nothing in CI exercises a real model or API. If your change
  touches request or response conversion, a model backend, or any outbound
  integration, run it once against the real thing and say so in the PR — which
  model or API, and what you asserted. If you cannot, say that instead. Both
  answers are useful. Silence reads as "tested".

## Boundaries

**Always**
- Run build, tests, lint, and `go mod tidy -diff` before declaring done.
- Keep PRs small and focused — one concern per PR.
- Add or update tests for the code you change.

**Ask first**
- Adding or upgrading a dependency (`go.mod`).
- Changing a high-fan-in package (`session`, `agent`, `model`, `tool`,
  `runner`) — prefer additive, backward-compatible changes.
- Any change to the public API surface, and any breaking change.

**Never**
- Break the public API — keep changes backward-compatible. An `apidiff` check
  compares every module against the merge base and fails on an incompatible
  change. A `breaking-change` label downgrades that failure to a report, so
  applying it is a deliberate decision to make with a maintainer, not a way
  round a red check.
- Edit vendored code (`internal/httprr`) or commit secrets / API keys.
- Add tests that make live LLM or network calls.

## Before you open a PR

Run the module loop under [Setup & core commands](#setup--core-commands) first.
Then three things no command does for you, and the [Self-review](#self-review)
pass that follows them.

**1. Prove your tests fail without your fix.** Revert your source change, keep
your tests, and run the package. If it stays green your test pins nothing, which
is the most common defect found in review here. Restore the change, then do the
same to each new guard, branch and error path in turn: delete or invert it,
re-run, confirm the suite goes red, put it back. A test you have never seen fail
is not yet a test.

**2. Say what changes for someone already on the current release.** If they
upgrade to a build containing your change, what behaves differently? Write it in
the PR description in plain terms. This includes bug fixes: a fix that alters an
observable result is still a behavior change, and an undeclared one is the
second most common defect found in review. If nothing changes for an existing
user, say that instead.

**3. Title the PR as a Conventional Commit.** `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:` and so
on, optionally scoped as `fix(runner):`. Release tooling reads the landed
subject to choose the next version and build the release notes, and it skips
anything with no recognized type without reporting an error. A mistitled PR
merges green and then goes missing from the changelog.

## Self-review

Read the change as if someone else wrote it, before you open the PR and again
before any later push that changes code. Small documentation and typo fixes are
exempt, as they are from the linked-issue and testing requirements. Everything
else gets the pass regardless of size, because most review rounds here go on
defects the author's own agent could have found.

**Review in a fresh context.** Start a new session, or hand the diff to a
subagent that did not write the code. An agent reviewing work it produced in
the same session re-reads its own intent rather than the diff, and passes it.
Give the reviewer the whole diff (`git diff origin/main...HEAD`), never a
summary — the summary is the author's account of the change, which is the thing
being checked. If that command prints nothing, work out why before continuing.

Five things to check:

1. **Correctness and tests** — edge cases (nil, empty, cancellation, concurrent
   use, partial streams), every caller of a function you changed, and whether
   the revert check reached each new guard rather than only the headline fix.
2. **Scope** — one concern per PR, and nothing the issue did not ask for. A
   drive-by CI, formatting or refactor fix belongs in its own PR.
3. **Simplicity** — duplicated logic, single-use indirection, dead code,
   defensive branches for cases that cannot happen, and comments that restate
   what the code does.
4. **Style** — the
   [Google Go Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/index) and
   the conventions in this file.
5. **Parity** — what adk-python does, cited by file and line.

What comes back is a set of claims, not facts. Check each one against the code
yourself, and drop the ones that do not hold.

`.agents/skills/adk-go-self-review/SKILL.md` carries the method and the
checklist behind each of the five.

## PRs & commits

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full process and CLA. Key points for agents:

- Code follows the
  [Google Go Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/index).
- Most PRs, beyond trivial docs and typo fixes, need a linked issue.
- Include a **Testing Plan**.
- Attach logs or screenshots for behavior changes (Runner output / ADK Web).

## Alignment with adk-python

[adk-python](https://github.com/google/adk-python) is the source of truth for
feature behavior. Before you port or change behavior, read the Python
implementation and cite the file and line you checked in the PR description.
Diverging deliberately is fine and needs one sentence saying why, in the code
comment where it will be read and in the PR.

When the question is design rather than behavior, the other ports are worth a
look — [Java](https://github.com/google/adk-java),
[Kotlin](https://github.com/google/adk-kotlin),
[TypeScript](https://github.com/google/adk-js). If one already solved this,
match it instead of inventing a third answer.

## 🛡️ Strict Embedding Separation, Zero-Fallback Law & 24/7 Dual-GPU Invariant
- **Reference**: `/home/m1st/.agents/rules/RULE_Strict_Embedding_Separation_And_Dual_Pipeline.md`

### 1. Das Absolute Fallback-Verbot (Zero-Fallback Law)
Unter keinen Umständen, zu keinem Zeitpunkt und aus keinem Grund darf ein Fallback zwischen verschiedenen Embedding-Modellen stattfinden.
* **Geltende Aktion:** Fällt ein Embedding-Modell aus oder ist überlastet, MUSS die Operation sofort hart fehlschlagen (`Fail-Fast`) oder die Payload transaktional in einer Queue (NATS/SQLite) verharren, bis das exakte Modell bereit ist.
* **Verboten:** Kein stiller oder dynamischer Modellwechsel (weder Jina -> Gemma noch umgekehrt).

### 2. Warum ein Embedding-Fallback mathematisch & informationstheoretisch unmöglich ist
* **Topologische Inkompatibilität heterogener Vektorräume (Non-Isomorphism):**
  Jedes Modell $f_\theta: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^D$ projiziert Text in eine spezifische, gelernte Riemannsche Mannigfaltigkeit. Jina v5 ($D=256$) und EmbeddingGemma ($D=768$) spannen zwei völlig inkompatible geometrische Räume auf. Die Basisvektoren der semantischen Achsen sind ohne explizite Procrustes-Transformation nicht ausgerichtet.
* **Kollaps der Kosinus-Ähnlichkeit ($	ext{sim} \approx 0$):**
  Wird eine Suchanfrage mit Modell $B$ berechnet ($v_q = f_B(q)$), während der Dokumentenkorpus mit Modell $A$ indiziert wurde ($v_d = f_A(d)$), verhält sich das Skalarprodukt mathematisch wie das zweier rein zufälliger Vektoren auf einer hochdimensionalen Einheitssphäre:
  $$\mathbb{E}[\text{sim}(u, v)] = 0 \quad \text{mit Varianz} \quad \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{D}$$
  Der Nearest-Neighbor-Algorithmus (HNSW/k-NN) liefert stochastisches Rauschen. Das RAG-System erhält völlig falsche oder irrelevante Kontexte.
* **Irreversible Index-Vergiftung (Index Poisoning):**
  Wird auch nur ein einziger Vektor von Modell $B$ als "Fallback" in den Index von Modell $A$ geschrieben, verunreinigt er die Distanzgraphen und Clusterzentren dauerhaft.
* **Das Gesetz des Fail-Fast:**
  Ein Ausfall muss hart abbrechen (`HTTP 503 Service Unavailable / IngestionQueueBlocked`).

### 3. Duale 24/7 Erfassungspflicht (GPU-Only)
* **GPU-Only Mandat:** Es läuft absolut nichts auf der CPU — GPU ONLY (NVIDIA GB10 CUDA) für ausnahmslos jedes Embedding-Modell.
* **24/7 Parallelität:** Sowohl `jina-embeddings-v5-omni-nano-classification` (256D, ~4,1 GB VRAM) als auch `google/embeddinggemma-300m` (768D, ~1,2 GB VRAM) laufen dauerhaft 24/7 im VRAM (Summe ~5,3 GB VRAM).
* **Duale Erfassung:** Jeder zu indizierende Text/Chunk wird immer von beiden Modellen parallel eingebettet und getrennt persistiert.

### 4. Idioten- & Failsafe-Sicherung auf Datenbankebene
* **SQLite Schema CHECK-Constraints:**
  `model_signature TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(model_signature = '...')` und `dimension INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK(dimension = ...)` erzwingen atomare Abbrüche auf Engine-Ebene bei Modell-Mismatches.
* **Qdrant Collection Constraints:**
  Strikte Trennung in separate Collections (`dgx_text_embeddings_jina_256` vs `dgx_text_embeddings_gemma_768`) mit fixierter Vektordimension.
